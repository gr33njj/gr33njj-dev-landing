# Vibe Coding vs Engineering Discipline

"Vibe coding" is often misunderstood as messy, cowboy coding. But when paired with strong engineering discipline, it becomes a powerful accelerator.

## The Flow State

Trusting your intuition allows you to bypass analysis paralysis. You write code as fast as you think.

## The Safety Net

This only works if you have:
1. **Types**: TypeScript catches the silly mistakes.
2. **Tests**: CI/CD ensures you don't break production.
3. **Observability**: You know immediately if something is wrong.

## Conclusion

Move fast, but keep your foundation solid.
